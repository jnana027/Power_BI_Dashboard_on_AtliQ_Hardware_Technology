# Power_BI_Dashboard_on_AtliQ_Hardware_Technology
This BI dashboard will help the AtliQ_Hardware_Technology to analyse the sales of their electronic devices in different countries and make insightful decision to grow their revenue and recognize the area where the performance is not up-to-the-mark.

Tools:MySQL,Excel,Power BI

The data is loaded, transformed(with power query editor), and visualized with the help of Power BI.

This is a multiple-page report which is more than 25 mb, so I could not upload the iriginal file. However, I uploaded some screenshot of showing what I put into together to analyse the business data.

This is a home page which is the main page and it can take you to othere pages with the Data modeling where dimensions tables are the outer ones and the main transaction table is fact_actual_estimates where all the important attributes are listed.
